    ->She is known for human rights advocacy, especially the education of women and children in her native Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northwestern Pakistan, where the Pakistani Taliban have at times banned girls from attending school.<br><br>
    -> Her advocacy has grown into an international movement, and according to former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, she has become Pakistan's "most prominent citizen.<br>
    ->The daughter of education activist Ziauddin Yousafzai, she was born to a Yusufzai Pashtun family in Swat and named after the Afghan national heroine, Malalai of Maiwand.<br><br>

    ->On 9 October 2012, while on a bus in Swat District after taking an exam, Yousafzai and two other girls were shot by a Taliban gunman in an assassination attempt in retaliation for her activism; the gunman fled the scene.<br><br>
    ->Yousafzai was hit in the head with a bullet and remained unconscious and in critical condition at the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, but her condition later improved enough for her to be transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK.<br><br>
    ->The attempt on her life sparked an international outpouring of support for her. Deutsche Welle reported in January 2013 that she may have become "the most famous teenager in the world".<br><br><br>
